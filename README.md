# librespot4pi
# A frontend for librespot java, designed to run on raspberry pi
## Hardware
Raspberry Pi 4 (1GB)\
Raspberry Pi 7" Touch Display\
[OPT] POE HAT\
[OPT] DAC+ HAT
## Applicaton/Intention
This is intented to be used on premises that are impractical to be tied to a certain Spotify account (Like a public space or workplace).\
Using Spotify Connect with Librespot, anyone can connect to the device and navigate it (ideally) like a Google Nest Hub.
## Progress
Currently only the main landing page has been designed (its only been a few hrs) and the api mapped out and experimented with.\
Code may (or may not) yet be available on the repo, likewise for a disk image/container.\
Expect this to be in a usable state by early 2023.
